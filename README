Is this a defect with Razor nested layouts?

'render' an optional section in a parent layout

reference the parent layout from a child layout

reference the child layout from a view 

define the section in the view, the section is rendered from the parent layout

throws an error

	The following sections have been defined but have not been rendered for the layout page "~/Views/Sample/_LayoutChild.cshtml": "HtmlHead".
